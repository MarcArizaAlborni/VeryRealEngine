# **_VeryRealEngine_** 

This is a university project made by two students of [CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/), 
in Barcelona. We made a 3D Game Engine in C & C++ during our 3rd year of Game Development Bachelorâ€™s Degree. In our case we also used Wwise to implement our High Level Audio System.

# **_Core Subsystems_**

### UI

The UI was done using ImGui. The different menus are: Herarchy Menu, Inspector Menu, Time Management Menu, Resource Manager Menu and Console with Logs.

### GameObjects

GameObjects are are the fundamental objects that can represent meshes, cameras, audios, etc. They can have the following components:

#### Transform

Allows the user to change the position, rotation and scaling fo a certain Game Object.

#### Mesh

A simple 3D mesh that can be in screen.

#### Camera

A culling camera customizable.

#### Audio Source

A GameObject that has a source with an audio file to listen to.

#### Audio Listener

This Game Object allows all the audio source to be heared. It represents the ears of the users.

### Audio Subsystem

Our Audio System is implemented using and supporting Wwise. To make It work, you have to import a an audio file in Wwise and vinculate an event to It. Once this is done, you can assign to any GameObject (except the camera, as this most of the times will be the listener) an Audio Source. In the inspector you can change the volume of the source and decide if you want that audio to be an spatial or non-spatial audio (depends if It's a song or sfx). If it is spatial, the volume will change depending on the distance of the listener from the specific audio source. That distance can be changed varying in inspector the radius of the spatial sphere inside the Audio Source. 

You can also apply any effect you want in a Game Paremeter. Inside Wwise you can create a Game Paremeter and assign It to an audio. Then, changing the RTPC value at your convinience, you can modify the instensity of the effect you chose. In our case, the value changes when the tunnel OBB detects that the fish OBB is inside, an there the audio distorts and creates the tunnel effect.
